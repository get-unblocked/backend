“Try Unblocked” is used by Next Chapter Software to demonstrate Unblocked in a real-world app. Because much of the power of Unblocked comes from rendezvousing source code with decisions, discussions and documents made outside of the code, the “Try Unblocked” Github repo is connected to Slack for discussions, Jira for tasks/issues and Confluence for documents.
