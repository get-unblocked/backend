## Introduction
The storage service is designed to manage the storage, retrieval, and organization of data in a system, utilizing a PostgreSQL database to ensure data integrity and availability.

## High-Level Architecture
The storage service is built as a RESTful API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to handle data storage operations. It acts as an intermediary between client applications and the database, encapsulating the data storage logic and providing a simplified interface for data management.

## Component Diagram
A component diagram showing the interaction between the storage service, PostgreSQL database, client applications, and other backend services would be included here.

## Database Schema
The database schema comprises tables for data records, metadata, access permissions, and other relevant information. Details of the schema with table definitions, relationships, and indices should be outlined in this section.

## API Endpoints
- `/storage/upload`: Handles the upload of new data.
- `/storage/download`: Handles the download of existing data.
- `/storage/metadata`: Provides metadata information for stored data.
- `/storage/delete`: Handles deletion of data.
- `/storage/search`: Enables searching and filtering of stored data.

## Data Flow
1. Client applications initiate data storage operations via the provided API endpoints.
2. The storage service processes these requests, performing necessary validation and formatting before interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
3. Data is stored, retrieved, or modified in the database as per the request.
4. The storage service returns the appropriate response to the client application, including any requested data or operation status information.

## Error Handling
Error handling includes capturing and logging database errors, handling invalid or malformed requests, and managing data integrity constraints.

## Security Considerations
Security considerations include validating input to prevent SQL injection attacks, using HTTPS for all communication, and ensuring proper access control for data operations.

## Performance Considerations
Performance considerations include optimizing database queries, indexing critical paths in the database schema, and caching frequently accessed data.

## Testing Strategy
Testing strategies include unit testing the storage service, integration testing with the PostgreSQL database, and end-to-end testing of the data flow.

## Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring and logging considerations include tracking data operation failures, monitoring the health and performance of the PostgreSQL database, and logging critical events for analysis.

## Future Improvements
Future improvements may include supporting additional data types, enhancing metadata management, and optimizing performance further.

## Appendices
Any additional diagrams, code snippets, or configuration details related to the storage service would be included here.

# Implementation Notes
- We are using Deno for the storage api and PostgreSQL as the database.
